# Restaurant Recommendation
My favorite restaurant in New Scotland which is just south of Albany is a little take out pizza and italian dinner place in a plaza.  It is called pizza by Dominics.  I am a little biased because I have worked there for the last 3 years.  But growing up my family would order from there every friday night. My favorite item is the lemon chicken dinner.
